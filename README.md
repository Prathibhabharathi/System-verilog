Interface:  All related signals are grouped together to form an interface block so that the same interface can be re-used for other projects.
Signals connected to the DUT should support 4-states so that X/Z values can be caught
ðŸ”¹Clocking blocks â†’ Synchronize driving and sampling of signals with clock edges.
ðŸ”¹Modports â†’ Define direction of signals for different roles (e.g., DUT vs TB).
